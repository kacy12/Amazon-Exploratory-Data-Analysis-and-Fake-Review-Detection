User behavior/fake review analysis:


1. User rating percentage 

First, to use different ‘user review ID’ to count the  total number of reviews of this user (i.e. name total-count).

Then, we can count how many times this user had given for 5 star, 4 star, 3 star, 2 star and 1 star reviews (ie. name 5-start-c、4-start-c、3-start-c、2-start-c、1-start-c). 

Calculate the percentage:  5-start-c/total-count、4-start-c/total-count、3-start-c/total-count、2-start-c/total-count、1-start-c/total-count. 

2. Unusual user behavior

Using the percentage results from step 1 to decide which user ID we would like to do more analysis. For example, if the result indicates user A’s 5 start rating percentage is much higher than average user’s 5 star rating percentage, we would like to examine more user A’s behavior pattern, to see if it is unusual.

First, to count how many times the user had been given reviews to a certain product, group by ‘user review ID’ and  ‘item_ID’ to calculate count and rating of different products. 

If user A had repeatedly reviewed the same product a lot and constantly giving a high review (much higher than the product’s average rating), it might indicate that this user’s behavior is abnormal and reviews from user A  is lack of credibility.
